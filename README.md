# screeps
This is my first screeps baby. All of my room objects are prototyped and my creeps operate by calling role functions. I iterate over each object in the game loop and call a report function, then I call functions for each creep and structure I own by its role. I am about to have my second big patch after three years of work, and this code base can now be public.
