 /*
   We start by agreeing that the best way to program practical frameworks in a
 turn based RTS is to evaluate the current state at every atomic resolution of
 time, in this case the tick. Every tick, we want to update our information as
 efficiently as possible while still maintaining current information to build,
 harvest, and defend by. This is my attempt at executing an engine operating
 within this category of simulations that emulates a philosophy of "Iterate
 once, execute once" as a baseline for having perfect information at it's most
 efficient of costs. We start with items that are independant to our access via
 the API, aka things we do not own or control except as an external force.
 */
 //creep reporting//
 /*
 All creep need to do these every turn so we do them first:
 -If we are tracking a population, census reporting should happen. Population
   only needs to be edited when creep are born or die.
 -If a creep is hungry we should change their memory to indicate they are
 -The first two creep per spawn that are hungry should get in line to eat
 -If a creep is damaged it should report for aid
 -If a creep has energy it's energyState should be 1, else 0
 -If a creep with a destination can not move it should re-path
 -If a creep has nothing to do, it should evaluate it's usefulness per cycle
   and decide if it should live or not. We can use transaction data relevant to
   the creep to decide this by programming in energy transaction logs and move
   efficiency.
 -If a creep is outdated for the current rcl and the new creep have been
   generated, it should sacrifice itself.
 -We should bear in mind that we want to maintain live info while also not
   making tons of checks. This means we should look for ways to only check creep
   that need to be checked. We acheive this by making them sad when they need
   something.
